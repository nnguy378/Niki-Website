        Hello, my name is Niki Nguyen. I'm currently an undergraduate and first year student at UCR. I plan on majoring in Business Administration in the near future; however, I am currently enrolled under Pre-Business. Prior to entering college, a lot of my work experience revolved around volunteer work. I spent most of my summers assisting my old elementary school coaches during their summer sports programs. Other volunteer work I participated in were through organizations my high school granted students the opportunity with, like through clubs or mini programs.  I was also involved in student government and held a position as class president. During my term, I organized two proms, multiple rallies, school dances and events as well as managed sports games and advertisements for the school. This entailed a lot of time dedicated after school to either choreograph dances, design invitations or posters, write scripts, direct assemblies, and sell tickets and merchandise. At times when it was called for, I would also help prepare food and sell them to raise money for the event. I also worked part-time at customer service jobs such as fast food chains and retail for about two years as a high school student. My interest for business peaked most when I was invited to a program that allowed me to get hands-on experiences as both a “college” student majoring in business and an internship before actually enrolling in college. Through the program I was able to improve my public speaking and team management skills. I was also able to brush up on some of my other skills such as video editing and designing to market my group and I’s products during this program. These are some skills I picked up on that were self-taught from elementary school. I aspire to build upon these skills and acquire much more during my years in college before entering the workforce.
